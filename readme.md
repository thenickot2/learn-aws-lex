# Learn AWS Lex

Project to learn [AWS Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) via a lambda function to query movie data. Heavily based on the AWSLabs example: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lex-convo-bot-example

Some data and tests based on [ChatterBot training data](https://github.com/gunthercox/chatterbot-corpus/blob/master/chatterbot_corpus).
